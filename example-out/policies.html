<h2>Computers and Accounts</h2>

<p>The Computer Science Dept. provides computers
    that you may use for your programming assignments. The Linux
    computer labs are located on the first floor and in the
    basement of the Talmage Building. You will need a Computer
    Science Dept. computer account in order to access these
    machines. (This account is different than your Route-Y
    account.) If you do not already have a Computer Science Dept.
    account, go to the web page at the following link to create or
    enable your account.</p>

<p>Your CS computer account can be set up here: <a href="https://accounts.cs.byu.edu/">accounts.cs.byu.edu</a><br>
    Account setup instructions are here: <a
        href="https://docs.cs.byu.edu/doku.php?id=setting-up-your-account-with-the-cs-authentication-system">Setting Up
        Your Account</a>
</p>

<p>Abuse of BYU computers, networks, or facilities involving
    either pornography or illegal activity will result in loss of
    all Computer Science accounts and removal from all CS classes.
    Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.cs.byu.edu/doku.php?id=account-policies-lab-rules">CS Dept.
        Lab Rules and Policies</a> for information regarding
    appropriate lab, computer, and account use.
    If you prefer, you can watch this entertaining video to learn about our lab policies:
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NisrJqzAWOc">Lab Policies Video</a>
    You will be held accountable for understanding and abiding by these
    policies.</p>

<p>If you would like to access the CS Dept. computers remotely, you can find instructions
    for doing so here: <a href="https://docs.cs.byu.edu/doku.php?id=vpn-configuration-and-use">Remote VPN Access</a>
</p>

<h2>CS Dept. Retake Policy(The Two Strikes Policy)</h2>
<p>
    Students are allowed only one retake of any class.
    If a student withdraws from or fails a class a second time,
    the student will not be allowed to register for any CS course
    for one semester (or one term, if in spring or summer).
    This policy does not apply to classes dropped before the add/drop deadline.
</p>
<p>
    After one semester (or term), a student must petition to be
    allowed to take CS courses again.
    The petition must provide evidence of a substantive change that
    makes success in future CS classes much more likely.
    For example, a student may have demonstrated success in technology,
    math, or science-based courses.
    The petition will be reviewed by the undergraduate advisor.
</p>
<p>
    Petitions for non-academic (e.g., medical or military) exceptions
    to the one semester/term waiting period may be granted according
    to university policies.
    Information about filing a petition can be found here:

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic integrity involves the honesty and energy with which you pursue knowledge and learning. This is reflected in
    the honor code:
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p class="mb-0">BYU students should seek to be totally honest in their dealings with others. They should
            complete
            their own work and be evaluated based upon that work. They should avoid academic dishonesty and misconduct
            in
            all its forms, including plagiarism, fabrication or falsification, cheating, and other academic misconduct.

            Intentional Plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one’s
            own
            without
            providing proper attribution to the author through quotation, reference, or footnote.

            Inadvertent Plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but nondeliberate, use of another's words, ideas, or data
            without
            proper attribution. Inadvertent plagiarism usually results from an ignorant failure to follow established
            rules
            for
            documenting sources or from simply being insufficiently careful in research and writing. Although not a
            violation of the
            Honor Code, inadvertent plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose
            appropriate
            academic sanctions. Students who are in doubt as to whether they are providing proper attribution have the
            responsibility to consult with their instructor and obtain guidance.
        </p>
        <footer class="blockquote-footer">
            <cit>BYU Honor Code</cit>
        </footer>
    </blockquote>

    It is also important to practice integrity in the way you pursue learning, or in other words, the eagerness with
    which
    you seek to improve yourself. When you attempt to skate through a class with
    a minimal effort, you cheat yourself. The punishment that tends to result from such “cheating” is a lower grade. But
    the
    negative impacts are really much deeper than that.
    Bottom line… Be honest with your teacher and with your fellow students. Also be honest with yourself. Dive in and
    get
    the most out of this class experience. This is a class in which you’ll get out
    of it largely what you put in.

<h2>Preventing Sexual Harassment</h2>
<p>Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in an educational
    program or activity that receives federal funds. The act is intended to eliminate sex discrimination in education.
    Title
    IX covers discrimination in programs, admissions, activities, and student-to-student sexual harassment.

    BYU's policy against sexual harassment extends not only to employees of the university, but to students as well. If
    you
    encounter sexual harassment, gender-based discrimination, or other inappropriate behavior, please talk to your
    professor
    or department chair, or contact the BYU Equal Employment Opportunity Office at 422-5895, or contact the Honor Code
    Office at 422-2847.</p>
<br>
<h2>Students with Disabilities</h2>
<p>Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates
    qualified persons with disabilities. If you have any disability that may impair your completing this course
    successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (801-422-2767). Reasonable academic accommodations
    are
    reviewed for all students who have qualified documented disabilities. Services are coordinated with the student and
    instructor by the UAC.</p></div></html>
