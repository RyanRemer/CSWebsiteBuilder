    This course is the first of three one-credit learning lab courses--focusing mostly on hands-on
    experiences--that will be required of students in the software engineering emphasis.

    This course will prepare students planning to pursue a software engineering career by giving them an opportunity to
    learn early in their computer science education about what software engineering is. They will also develop and build
    on good software engineering skills and habits before bad habits are formed. Students will also develop knowledge
    of, and
    experience with, several tools, technologies, and techniques they will use in a software engineering career. This
    knowledge will benefit them in later CS courses. This course will be useful to students pursuing a software
    engineering emphasis and to students wanting to evaluate whether a software engineering career is the best career
    path for them.
