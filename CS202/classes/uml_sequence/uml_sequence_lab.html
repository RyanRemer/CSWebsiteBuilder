Here is an outline of the functionality you are to model:</p><p></p><ul><li>A student tries to add the course to his or her course schedule</li><li>The system uses the student&rsquo;s ID to confirm that the student is a current student</li></ul><ul><li>If the student is not a current student, the system returns an error and the process terminates</li></ul><ul><li>The system checks to see if the student has exceeded the credit limit</li></ul><ul><li>If the student has exceeded the credit limit, the system returns an error and the process terminates</li></ul><ul><li>The system checks to see if the student has fulfilled the prerequisites</li></ul><ul><li>If the student has not fulfilled the prerequisites, the system returns an error and the process terminates</li></ul><ul><li>If there were no errors, the course is added to the student&rsquo;s course schedule and a success message is returned</li></ul><p></p><p>Your sequence diagram must show at least the above interactions. You may add other relevant interactions to your sequence diagram if you wish.</p><p></p><p>Here are some classes/object instances you might find helpful for your sequence diagram:</p><p></p><ul><li>Student</li><li>CourseSchedule</li><li>CourseDatabase</li><li>StudentDatabase</li><li>CourseCatalog</li><li>Course</li></ul><p></p><p>These classes are suggestions. You may use other classes, or omit some of these classes as long as you fulfill the requirements of the lab and your diagram makes sense. You must produce your diagram using LucidChart.</p><h1>Instructions</h1><p>This lab is an individual&nbsp;lab. You may not work with another person.</p><p></p><p>For this lab, you do not need to worry about what class triggers the sequence of events to start. You may draw an arrow coming in from the left to signify the origin of the call to the sequence diagram.</p><p></p><ol start="1"><li>Decide what classes/objects/roles you will use to represent the operation.</li><li>Create a lifeline for each object.</li><li>Draw the interactions between all of the classes using proper UML syntax. Be sure to include activation bars. </li><li>Label each of the interactions.</li><li>You are allowed to use your UML cheat sheet and other online resources for this lab.</li><li>Submit your completed sequence diagram (as a PDF) to LearningSuite.</li></ol><div><p></p></div></body></html>
