<p class="display-4">Pre-Class Reading</p>
<p>Read the following articles.You should&nbsp;follow along
        with the first article in IntelliJ, but not the second and third articles (you can&rsquo;t really follow
        along anyway). Don&rsquo;t worry if you get confused, just try to keep track of the important features and
        what to use them for. While you likely don&rsquo;t have exposure to writing multithreaded and/or
        asynchronous applications, and you won&rsquo;t have exposure to debugging them, some of the important
        features are showcased for debugging multithreaded applications. Most of them do not&nbsp;need to be used on multithreaded applications.</p>
<h1>Readings</h1>
<h2>Debugging Basics</h2>
<p>The pictures of the icons in the text are old, but the keyboard shortcuts are still correct and
        the screenshots are up-to-date&nbsp;enough for you to follow along with a current version of
        Intellij. You will need to write the HelloWorld application before following along with the article. Find it
        by clicking on the &ldquo;Before you start&hellip;&rdquo; link.</p>

<h2>Advanced Debugging Features</h2>
<p>The next article goes over many features, several of which you will not use
        frequently, if ever. However, it is important that you have exposure to them in the event you need or want
        to use them. The tutorial for class will use some of these features. They can be incredibly useful at
        times.</p>

<p>You should read until &ldquo;Debugging long running scenarios.&rdquo; Reading more is considered part of the additional reading for this day.</p>

<p>Most of the skills related to debugging are developed through actually debugging
        programs. When and where to set breakpoints and what kinds of conditions to set are mostly intuitive skills
        that you develop with experience.</p>
