    <p>After the reading quiz, the your instructor will go through the Character.java&nbsp;file to demonstrate what to
        look for in a code review. After the demo is done, you will pair up with someone in the class and review some
        classes related to the one the you reviewed as a class. Your assignment is to submit, as a pair, a list of
        issues you find in the given classes. To receive full credit you must find at least 12 issues, and at least two
        issues in each class. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Be sure to include the name of both reviewers when you submit the assignment to LearningSuite. Both reviewers
        should individually submit the same document to LearningSuite. Submit your findings with the following format:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <div>
        <p>Class name</p>
        <p>Line # - issue description</p>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <div>
        <p>Sword</p>
        <p>Line 4 - Missing constructor</p>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>

    </ul>
