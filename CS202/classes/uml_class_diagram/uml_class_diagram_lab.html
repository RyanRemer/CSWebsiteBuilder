    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>For this assignment you will create a class diagram for a mechanic shop. You must produce the diagram using
        LucidChart. This is an individual&nbsp;lab. You may not work with another person.</p>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a Class Diagram to model a mechanic shop. Include the following classes in your diagram:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>MechanicShop</li>
            <li>Mechanic</li>
            <li>Car</li>
            <li>CarPart</li>
            <li>Engine</li>
            <li>Wheel</li>
            <li>Owner</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Include the following relationships in your diagram:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A composition relationship between MechanicShop and Mechanic</li>
            <li>An association between MechanicShop and Car</li>
            <li>A composition relationship between Car and CarPart</li>
            <li>An inheritance relationship between CarPart and Engine</li>
            <li>An inheritance relationship between CarPart and Wheel</li>
            <li>An association between Mechanic and Car</li>
            <li>An association between Car and Owner</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Add multiplicity constraints and relationship names to the association relationships.</li>
        <li>Add appropriate attributes for each class. You do not need to include methods.</li>
        <li>You are allowed to use your UML cheat sheet and other online resources for this lab.</li>
        <li>Submit your completed class diagram (as a PDF) to LearningSuite.</li>
