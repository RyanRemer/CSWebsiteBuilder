    <p></p>
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Debugging is a central concept and required skill of software engineering. To succeed in your classwork and your
        eventual career, it is essential that you gain skills in a wide variety of debugging tools. In today&rsquo;s
        tutorial, we will show you how to use print statements to debug a simple program.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In this tutorial, we have given you a simple java program, SquareRoot.java. This program takes a positive number
        (either integer or double) as input and returns the square root. This particular program has some run-time
        errors in it; however, so it is not working properly. We will guide you through the debugging process and teach
        you how to use print statements to find and fix the bugs in the program.</p>
    <h1>Tutorial</h1>
    <p>Understanding the Algorithm</p>
    <p>This program uses a convergence algorithm to calculate the square root. This means that at every step in the
        execution, the program makes a &ldquo;guess&rdquo; as to the correct solution based on some criteria, and then
        refines the guess at each step until it converges on the correct solution. It sets bounds, high&nbsp;and low, to
        restrict the range of values that the program can get. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Initially, low&nbsp;is set to 0 and high&nbsp;is set to the number we&rsquo;re calculating the square root for.
        In each iteration, the guess that the algorithm makes for the solution is the midpoint between high&nbsp;and
        low. The middle value is then squared and compared to the value we&rsquo;re solving for. If the square of the
        guess is greater than the number, the guess is too high, and so we set high&nbsp;to the current middle and
        continue executing. If the square of the guess is less than the number, the guess is too low, and so we set
        low&nbsp;to the current middle and continue executing. In this way, we gradually decrease the range of possible
        values until we have converged on a solution. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Because it may be impossible to calculate exact square roots for some values, the program runs until it has
        reached a specified level of precision. For this algorithm, we stop the loop and return a solution when the new
        guess and the old guess are the same to within the level of precision specified, indicating that we cannot
        improve on the guess anymore, and thus have found the correct solution. You could also stop the loop when
        high&nbsp;and low are the same within the level of precision specified.</p>

    <ol start="1">
        <li>Open the SquareRoot.java program in Intellij IDEA.
            <p>Spend a few minutes looking over the code to gain an understanding of what it does. This is a good first
                step when approaching a new piece of code.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="2">
        <li>Navigate to your file in the terminal.</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="3">
        <li>Compile the code with the following command:
            <p>javac SquareRoot.java</p>
            <p>The code should compile with no warnings or errors.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="4">
        <li>Now run the code with the following command:
            <p>java SquareRoot</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="images/image11.png"
                    style="width: 544.12px; height: 101.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The program crashed immediately with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Why didn&rsquo;t the compiler catch this
        error? Clearly the program is not even able to run. This kind of error is what is called a run-time error, as
        opposed to a compile-time error. Run time errors are errors that occur when the program is running, while
        compile-time errors are errors with syntax. So in this case, the program is syntactically correct but logically
        incorrect. The compiler can only catch syntactic errors, so errors like this Exception will only be found when
        you run your program. Run-time errors are often more difficult to debug than compile-time errors because the
        compiler cannot catch them, so you as the programmer must catch them. In this case, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to
        find the line that causes the error: SquareRoot.java:5&nbsp;(line 5 of the SquareRoot.java file).</p>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="5">
        <li>Go to line 5 of the SquareRoot.java program:
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image5.png"
                    style="width: 569.40px; height: 109.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>It looks like the program is crashing when we try to access args[0]. This would seem to indicate that
                args&nbsp;is an empty array. To be sure, place a temporary print statement before line 5 to see how many
                elements are in args:</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image14.png"
                    style="width: 569.50px; height: 106.78px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="6">
        <li>Compile and run the program again. You should now see the output of the print statement on the console just
            before the Exception output:
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image2.png"
                    style="width: 567.50px; height: 122.78px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>Sure enough, there aren&rsquo;t any elements in args. Why is this? It turns out args is empty because we
                didn&rsquo;t run the program with any command line arguments. SquareRoot.java expects one command line
                argument,
                a number to perform a square root on. Since we ran the program with the command java SquareRoot.java, no
                number
                was provided and the program crashed. To prevent this error from occurring in the future, we need to
                only allow
                the program to run if it is given at least one command line argument.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="7">
        <li>Comment out the print statement and add the following lines of code to you SquareRoot.java file:
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image29.png"
                    style="width: 534.50px; height: 113.07px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>This will print out a short statement outlining the correct way to run the program and then exit. Compile
                and run
                the program again. You should see the usage statement printed to the console:</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image13.png"
                    style="width: 537.26px; height: 82.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p></p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="8">
        <li>Now that we&rsquo;ve fixed that error, it&rsquo;s time to test the program again. Let&rsquo;s try
            calculating the square root of 4.<p>Run the program with java SquareRoot 4</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image27.png"
                    style="width: 538.50px; height: 173.46px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>Now we&rsquo;re getting a different error&mdash;an IllegalFormatConversionException. It&rsquo;s a little
                difficult to tell what&rsquo;s going on, except that the error is at line 46.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p></p>
    <ol start="9">
        <li>Go to line 46 of you program and examine the print statement that is there:
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image4.png"
                    style="width: 543.50px; height: 74.03px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>Looks like the print formatter is complaining about the %.4f&nbsp;that we used to print out the variable
                number&nbsp;and middle. %f&nbsp;is used to print out floating-point numbers, but it&rsquo;s complaining
                about
                one of the arguments being an integer. How were number&nbsp;and middle&nbsp;defined? </p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image22.png"
                    style="width: 558.50px; height: 40.28px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>middle&nbsp;is defined on line 16 as a double&hellip;</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image16.png"
                    style="width: 555.75px; height: 45.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>But number&nbsp;is defined on line 13 as an int! This is clearly a mistake, as we had intended our
                program to be
                able to calculate square roots on decimal numbers as well. Changing the definition of number&nbsp;from
                int&nbsp;to double&nbsp;will fix this error. Don&rsquo;t forget to change Integer.parseInt&nbsp;to
                Double.parseDouble:</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image28.png"
                    style="width: 519.50px; height: 52.45px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This error showcases one important principle of debugging: sometimes the location of the error is
                different from
                the line displayed in the error message.&nbsp;This error occurred on line 13, when the variable
                number&nbsp;was
                improperly declared to be an int, but it wasn&rsquo;t caught until line 46, when we attempted to print
                out an
                int&nbsp;as a double. Often when debugging a program you will find that the location of an error is
                different
                from the location of its effects. Understanding this is key to being able to debug complex errors.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="10">
        <li>Change the type of number&nbsp;from int&nbsp;to double&nbsp;and compile and run the program again:<p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="images/image8.png"
                    style="width: 527.50px; height: 88.76px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>No exceptions this time, and the program calculated the square root! It&rsquo;s a little too early for
                celebration, however, as the program has calculated the square root of 4 to be 1.25. This is very
                clearly wrong,
                so we have an error in our algorithm somewhere. There&rsquo;s another interesting error displayed here:
                the
                number of iterations is 0. To understand why this is an error, we need to understand a little about what
                the
                program is doing.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This program calculates the square root by first making a &ldquo;guess&rdquo; to what the square root is,
                and
                then looping and performing calculations to improve this guess. It continues looping until the guess is
                accurate
                enough and then returns the solution. Even if the initial guess were correct, it would have to iterate
                at least
                once. For the number of iterations to be zero, either we would have to be skipping over the iterations
                entirely
                or not keeping track of how many times we&rsquo;ve looped.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p></p>
    <ol start="11">
        <li>Let&rsquo;s tackle the loop iteration error first, since it seems a lot easier to debug than the incorrect
            logic. We can figure out if we&rsquo;re entering the loop at all and how many times we&rsquo;re looping by
            placing a simple print statement within the loop:
            <p></p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image25.png"
                    style="width: 564.50px; height: 158.31px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>This print statement&nbsp;prints out the value of step, so we can see if it is being counted correctly.
                It also
                allows us to see if the loop is being executed, since it will not be printed if the loop is never
                entered. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="12">
        <li>Recompile the program and run again.
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image24.png"
                    style="width: 568.50px; height: 108.42px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>Now we can see that the loop is being executed, since the print statement printed twice. We can also see
                that the
                number of steps is being updated, but is being reset each time the loop iterates. Close inspection of
                the while
                loop shows that we are actually defining the step&nbsp;variable at the beginning of each iteration.</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image18.png"
                    style="width: 559.50px; height: 38.56px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>Clearly a local variable will not work to keep track of number of iterations, since step&nbsp;will be
                created at
                the beginning of each iteration and then go out of scope at the end of each iteration. To keep track of
                the
                number of iterations, we will need a variable that is available for the whole duration of the loop, or
                in other
                words one defined before the loop.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This brings up another question: if step&nbsp;goes out of scope when the while loop terminates, how are
                we able
                to print out its value? If we go to the print statement at the bottom:</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image17.png"
                    style="width: 568.50px; height: 42.82px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>We see that the variable being printed is called steps. This is not the same variable that is used in the
                loop&mdash;it is declared on line 17, set to 0, and then never used again until this print statement!
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Here we found two errors&mdash;we were trying to keep track of information with a variable that would go
                out of
                scope, and we were using a completely different variable to print out the number of iterations. Having
                two
                different instances of a variable designed to do the same thing is a very common error, especially when
                multiple
                people are collaborating on a file separately. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="13">
        <li>This error can be fixed by deleting the variable declaration at the beginning of the loop and replacing the
            two uses of steps&nbsp;with step. Your file should look like this:
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image3.png"
                    style="width: 552.50px; height: 372.76px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="14">
        <li>Recompile and rerun your program. You should now have the correct output for the number of iterations:
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image26.png"
                    style="width: 551.50px; height: 94.57px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>The square root is still being calculated incorrectly though. We know the loop is iterating, but we
                don&rsquo;t
                know if it&rsquo;s iterating enough times&nbsp;or if it&rsquo;s performing the correct calculations. We
                can find
                out by printing out the values of different variables of interest during each loop iteration.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="15">
        <li>Because there are a lot of values to keep track of, it&rsquo;s a good idea to put some information about
            each variable in the print statement. We can use printf&nbsp;instead of println&nbsp;to achieve
            this.&nbsp;printf&nbsp;is short for &ldquo;print formatted,&rdquo; and is an easy way to add formatting to

                    title=""></p>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the output. It looks like the middle&nbsp;calculations are working: first
                oldMiddle&nbsp;is 4 while middle&nbsp;is set to 1, and then oldMiddle&nbsp;is 1 in the next iteration
                while
                middle&nbsp;is updated to 1.25. The low&nbsp;and high&nbsp;variables seem reasonable
                too&mdash;there&rsquo;s no
                reason yet to doubt them.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>We can see immediately though that there is a problem with the algorithm. middleSquared&nbsp;is supposed
                to be
                the square of middle, but it has the incorrect value. In the first iteration, middleSquared&nbsp;should
                be 1,
                but it is 2. In the second iteration, middleSquared&nbsp;should be 1.5625, but it is 2.5.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="17">
        <li>We have found an error in the algorithm, so let&rsquo;s take a look at it in greater detail. Where is
            middleSquared&nbsp;being set?
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image10.png"
                    style="width: 543.50px; height: 55.74px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>middleSquared&nbsp;is set on line 31. But instead of squaring middle&nbsp;to get middleSquared, the
                program
                multiplies middle&nbsp;by 2. This will definitely mess up our algorithm. Change line 26 to read
                middleSquared =
                middle * middle;</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="18">
        <li>Recompile and rerun the program.
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image20.png"
                    style="width: 515.50px; height: 228.66px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>Now middleSquared&nbsp;is being calculated properly, but the square root is still wrong. In fact, it is
                giving
                the same value as before. Clearly there are still some errors left in the algorithm. Which variables
                should we
                look at?</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>middleSquared&nbsp;is being calculated correctly, and high&nbsp;and low&nbsp;still seem reasonable, so
                that just
                leaves oldMiddle&nbsp;and middle. oldMiddle&nbsp;is just set to middle&nbsp;at the beginning of each
                loop, so it
                doesn&rsquo;t seem like there is much that could go wrong there unless the calculation of
                middle&nbsp;is&nbsp;being done incorrectly. middle&nbsp;seems to be the most likely candidate for
                errors, so
                let&rsquo;s take a closer look at it.</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image6.png"
                    style="width: 571.50px; height: 54.04px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>middle&nbsp;is calculated on line 30 as (high + low) / 4. Hmm, this doesn&rsquo;t seem like the right way
                to
                calculate midpoint. This will give a value that is one quarter the value of the sum of low and high, not
                a value
                halfway in between them. The formula for midpoint is (high + low) / 2, so let&rsquo;s correct the code
                to
                accurately reflect the calculation of midpoint:</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image1.png"
                    style="width: 520.50px; height: 99.81px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="19">
        <li>Recompile and rerun the program.
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image30.png"
                    style="width: 528.31px; height: 343.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>Now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere! The algorithm now iterated 3 times instead of only 2. The value is
                still not
                correct, but 2.5 is closer to 2 than 1.25, so it seems like we&rsquo;re moving in the right direction.
                high&nbsp;is now decreasing as well, which is a good sign.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Now middle, oldMiddle, and middleSquared&nbsp;should all be calculated correctly, but the program is
                still
                returning the wrong value. Could high&nbsp;and low&nbsp;be calculated incorrectly? If we go to the lines
                where
                high&nbsp;and low are calculated:</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image31.png"
                    style="width: 556.50px; height: 86.51px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>It looks to be correct. We want to decrease the high end of the estimate as long as the square of the
                estimate is
                greater than the initial number, and we want to increase the low estimate otherwise. This code is
                functioning
                correctly, so where could the error be? </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>If we look at the calculations that are being made at each step, and how the value of middle&nbsp;changes
                with
                each iteration, 3 iterations doesn&rsquo;t seem like enough to perform the calculations correctly.
                Perhaps
                there&rsquo;s something wrong with the loop conditions.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at those conditions:</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image21.png"
                    style="width: 540.50px; height: 47.64px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>Looks like we are continuing to iterate as long as the difference between middle&nbsp;and
                oldMiddle&nbsp;is
                greater than or equal to 1. That doesn&rsquo;t seem quite right. This will only calculate a square root
                to
                within one whole number! We really want our square root function to be accurate to several decimal
                places.
                Let&rsquo;s change the comparison condition to 0.000001 instead of 1 and see what happens:</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image7.png"
                    style="width: 542.50px; height: 104.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <ol start="20">
        <li>Recompile and rerun the program.
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image9.png"
                    style="width: 542.50px; height: 348.63px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>Success! The program is now looping 22 times, which is much more like what we would expect to see.
                We&rsquo;re
                also now getting the correct answer for the square root! But it&rsquo;s a little too early to celebrate
                yet. The
                program correctly calculates the square root of 4, but it might not correctly calculate other values.
                Let&rsquo;s run it on a few other values to see if it is correctly calculating them. To simplify the
                output a
                bit, let&rsquo;s comment out our print statements:</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image15.png"
                    style="width: 529.50px; height: 106.07px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p></p>
    <ol start="21">
        <li>Recompile the program, and run it on a few different values:
            <p><img alt="" src="images/image23.png"
                    style="width: 528.50px; height: 311.87px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
                    title=""></p>
            <p>If you put all of those values into your calculator, they are all correct to 4 decimal places. It looks
                like
                we&rsquo;ve fixed all of the bugs in our square root program!</p>
