<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic integrity involves the honesty and energy with which you pursue knowledge and learning. This is reflected in
    the honor code:
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p class="mb-0">BYU students should seek to be totally honest in their dealings with others. They should
            complete
            their own work and be evaluated based upon that work. They should avoid academic dishonesty and misconduct
            in
            all its forms, including plagiarism, fabrication or falsification, cheating, and other academic misconduct.

            Intentional Plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one’s
            own
            without
            providing proper attribution to the author through quotation, reference, or footnote.

            Inadvertent Plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but nondeliberate, use of another's words, ideas, or data
            without
            proper attribution. Inadvertent plagiarism usually results from an ignorant failure to follow established
            rules
            for
            documenting sources or from simply being insufficiently careful in research and writing. Although not a
            violation of the
            Honor Code, inadvertent plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose
            appropriate
            academic sanctions. Students who are in doubt as to whether they are providing proper attribution have the
            responsibility to consult with their instructor and obtain guidance.

    It is also important to practice integrity in the way you pursue learning, or in other words, the eagerness with
    which
    you seek to improve yourself. When you attempt to skate through a class with
    a minimal effort, you cheat yourself. The punishment that tends to result from such “cheating” is a lower grade. But
    the
    negative impacts are really much deeper than that.
    Bottom line… Be honest with your teacher and with your fellow students. Also be honest with yourself. Dive in and
    get
    the most out of this class experience. This is a class in which you’ll get out
    of it largely what you put in.
